# Hey there 👋

I'm Alexey Troshin, former ESL teacher turned frontend developer. 

Although I enjoyed helping students learn, I discovered that my true calling was in building apps with great user experiences. I love diving into code and exploring the latest front-end technologies to create modern and responsive web apps.

#### ⚡️ Technologies I worked / am familiar with:

- React, Vue.js 2.x, Vue.js 3.x (Composition API), Nuxt.js 2.x, Next.js;
- Redux (React) / Zustand / Vuex (Vue) for state management;
- Webpack (loaders and setting up custom configs);
- TypeScript 💙;
- SCSS, LESS, BEM, CSS Modules; 
- Pug;
- Unit Testing with Jest;

Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on various projects, including data analysis and predictive modeling platforms, real estate, advertising, hotel business, translations. I'm always looking for new and exciting opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.

Apart from programming, I love cooking, travelling and playing video games. I believe that a good work-life balance is key to staying motivated and productive in my work.
